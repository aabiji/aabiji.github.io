# Object permanence
*April 15, 2025*

As babies, we learn about object impermanence â€“ the concept that objects continue to exist even when they're out of sight. Later, as teenagers, we start thinking about our legacy and the lasting impact we'll have on the world. It's an extension of that early lesson, but instead of objects, we wonder how people will remember us when we're gone.

For a long time, I wanted to have a Napoleon sized legacy, not to conquer empires, but to leave a massive mark. So, I obsessed for ways to achieve that: should I be a politician, CEO, scientist, or famous singer?

But then I realized I was asking the wrong question. It was the wrong mindset altogether.

Ambition isn't bad, but it comes down to this: I don't have to be Napoleon. Growing up with an overachieving mindset made it hard to accept this, but once I did, it made life easier. I don't need to be remembered; it'd be nice, but what would it matter when everyone would be forgotten eventually?

Living life based off of other people's validation isn't a great way to live. It makes more sense to focus on what I'm interested in and what makes me happy. The truth is, I wont''t have all the answers, and neither did Napoleon.
