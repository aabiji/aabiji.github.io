# Hi, I'm Abigail

I like [building things](https://github.com/aabiji?tab=repositories).
Some of the things I've made include:

- [LogBuddy](https://github.com/aabiji/logbuddy), a health tracking app
- [Focal](https://aabiji.github.io/focal/), a simple pomodoro website
- [Muse](https://github.com/aabiji/muse), a cli music player

I also like to write:

- [What do noise functions sound like?](noise.md)
- [Simplifying polylines to exactly *n* points](simplify-polyline.md)
- [Calling Java from a Gio UI Android App](go-jni.md)
- [Water levels and temperatures across Canada](lakes.md)
- [Drawing Apollonian Gaskets](gasket.md)
