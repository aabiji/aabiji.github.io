# Hi, I'm Abigail

I like [building software](https://github.com/aabiji?tab=repositories), and occasionally I also write:

- [Drawing 3D shapes using signed distance functions](sdfs.md)
- [What do noise functions sound like?](noise.md)
- [Simplifying polylines to exactly *n* points](simplify-polyline.md)
- [Calling Java from a Gio UI Android App](go-jni.md)
- [Water levels and temperatures across Canada](lakes.md)
- [Drawing Apollonian Gaskets](gasket.md)
