# Hi, I'm Abigail

I like [building software](https://github.com/aabiji), occasionally writing about things I find interesting.

- [Simplifying polylines to exactly *n* points](simplify-polyline.md)
- [Calling Java from a Gio UI Android App](go-jni.md)
- [Water levels and temperatures across Canada](lakes.md)
- [Drawing Apollonian Gaskets](gasket.md)
