<p><em>April 15, 2025</em></p>

<p>When marketing a product, it’s not about the product itself—it’s about how people <em>feel</em> about it. The app’s tech stack? Irrelevant. Its features? Might as well be meaningless. You could slap together a barely functional piece of shit, but if it’s backed by someone with clout, it’ll still spread like a wildfire.</p>

<p>Take the vibe coding trend that blew up on X for a few weeks. You had <a href="https://x.com/levelsio?lang=en">@levelsio</a> hyping his vibe-coded game, and it went viral. Companies were scrambling to buy ad space in it. But if you actually look at the game, it’s a clunky, insecure mess. But that doesn’t matter. People ate it up because <em>levelsio</em> made it. Meanwhile, some indie dev could pour their soul into a game for years, and it’ll barely get a glance. Why? Because they’re a nobody.</p>

<p>This isn’t just about apps—it applies to life in general, like belief systems. Religions, cults, and whatnot. The actual ideology doesn&rsquo;t even matter. As long as it hits people’s emotional and social buttons, they’ll convert and stay loyal.</p>

<p>The pattern’s clear: reason doesn’t drive people, emotions do. And emotions are way easier to manipulate. So, the real trick to winning at anything is to skip the logic and speak straight to the heart.</p>
