<p><em>April 15, 2025</em></p>

<p>As babies, we learn about object impermanence â€“ the concept that objects continue to exist even when they&rsquo;re out of sight. Later, as teenagers, we start thinking about our legacy and the lasting impact we&rsquo;ll have on the world. It&rsquo;s an extension of that early lesson, but instead of objects, we wonder how people will remember us when we&rsquo;re gone.</p>

<p>For a long time, I wanted to have a Napoleon sized legacy, not to conquer empires, but to leave a massive mark. So, I obsessed for ways to achieve that: should I be a politician, CEO, scientist, or famous singer?</p>

<p>But then I realized I was asking the wrong question. It was the wrong mindset altogether.</p>

<p>Ambition isn&rsquo;t bad, but it comes down to this: I don&rsquo;t have to be Napoleon. Growing up with an overachieving mindset made it hard to accept this, but once I did, it made life easier. I don&rsquo;t need to be remembered; it&rsquo;d be nice, but what would it matter when everyone would be forgotten eventually?</p>

<p>Living life based off of other people&rsquo;s validation isn&rsquo;t a great way to live. It makes more sense to focus on what I&rsquo;m interested in and what makes me happy. The truth is, I wont&rdquo;t have all the answers, and neither did Napoleon.</p>
