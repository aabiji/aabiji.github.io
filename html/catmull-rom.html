        <p>Suppose we want to draw a curved line that passes through a set
        of xy coordinates. We can use a Catmull-Rom spline to solve the problem,
        so how does it work?</p>
        <p>First of all, what&rsquo;s a spline? A spline is a mathematical tool for
        creating smooth, continuous curves through or near a set of points,
        often by stitching together cubic Bézier curves. A Bézier curve is
        a parametric, piecewise polynomial curve defined by control points
        that influence its shape. The curve is computed by interpolating
        the control points points using a parameter t∈[0,1],
        generating the curve as a weighted combination of the control points.
        In a regular spline, control points are manually defined and not
        part of the resulting curve, but in a Catmull-Rom spline, the
        curve passes directly through the supplied points, automatically
        determining its shape. My explanation is terrible, so here&rsquo;s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvPPXbo87ds">better
        one</a>.</p>
        <p>Catmull-Rom splines are defined by 4 control points; p0, p₁, p2, p3,
        α∈[0,1], which influences how the distances between the control
        points affect the resulting curve, [TODO: put image here] and
        t∈[0,1], which represents the distance between the start and end
        of the curve.</p>
